SocialMediaPro is a social media platform that allows users to share photos and videos. The platform wants 
to redesign its profile page to make it more user-friendly and visually appealing. The design team has decided
 to use a grid layout to display the user's posts, with three columns on desktop screens and two columns on
 mobile screens. However, they are facing issues with aligning the posts correctly. They want to ensure that 
all posts have equal width and height, regardless of their content.

The current HTML structure for a post is:

<div class="post">
  <img src="image.jpg" alt="Post image">
  <div class="post-content">
    <h2>Post title</h2>
    <p>Post description</p>
  </div>
</div>
What CSS rule should be applied to the .post container to achieve this layout using grid?

display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap;
grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
= display: grid; grid-template-columns: repeat(3, minmax(0, 1fr));
display: inline-grid; grid-template-columns: auto;
