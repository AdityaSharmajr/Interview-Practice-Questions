A lifestyle e-commerce company, FitnessHub, has a website that sells fitness-related products and offers workout
 routines to its customers. The website has a section dedicated to fitness blogs where customers can read and 
share their fitness experiences. The website is built using React and uses CSS3 for styling. The design team
 at FitnessHub wants to ensure that the blog section is responsive and accessible on various devices, including
 desktops, laptops, tablets, and mobile phones. They want to use media queries in CSS3 to achieve this.

The design team has identified three breakpoints for the website: 768px, 480px, and 320px. They want to apply 
different styles to the blog section based on these breakpoints. For devices with a screen width of 768px or 
more, they want to display three blog posts in a row. For devices with a screen width between 480px and 767px,
 they want to display two blog posts in a row. For devices with a screen width of 479px or less, they want to 
display one blog post in a row.

What CSS media query rule should the design team use to apply styles for devices with a screen width of 480px or more but less than 768px?

@media only screen and (min-width: 480px) { ... }

= @media only screen and (max-width: 767px) { ... }

@media only screen and (min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 479px) { ... }

@media only screen and (min-width: 320px) and (max-width: 480px) { ... }

Reason: This media query rule `@media only screen and (max-width: 767px)` correctly targets devices with a maximum screen width of 767px. 
However, it does not specify the minimum width required (480px).
