- As a frontend developer for a popular e-commerce website, you are tasked with redesigning the product search page to improve user 
experience and accessibility. The current design uses a generic <div> element to wrap the search result items, but you want to use
 semantic HTML5 elements to provide better structure and meaning to the page. You decide to use the <article> element to wrap each 
search result item, but you're not sure if it's the correct choice. The search result items typically contain a product image,
 product name, price, and a short description.

Which semantic HTML5 element would be more suitable for wrapping each search result item, considering the content and structure of the page?

Using the <section> element to wrap each search result item
Using the <nav> element to wrap each search result item
= Using the <article> element to wrap each search result item
Using the <aside> element to wrap each search result item

The <article> element is intended for self-contained content that could be independently distributable or reusable, such as a product listing in a search result.
Each search result item (product image, name, price, and description) represents a distinct unit that can be considered standalone content, making it a perfect fit for the <article> element.
