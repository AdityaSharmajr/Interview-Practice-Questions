As a frontend developer at a popular e-commerce company, you're working on a project to improve the search 
functionality of the website. The website is built using React and Redux, and you're tasked with implementing
 server-side rendering (SSR) to improve the SEO and page load times. The website receives a high volume of 
traffic, and the search results page is one of the most visited pages on the site. You've been asked to 
optimize the search results page for SSR. You're using Node.js as the server-side runtime environment. The
 search results page is currently rendered on the client-side, and you need to modify it to render on the
 server-side. The page uses Material-UI components for styling, and SASS for CSS preprocessing.

The search results page receives a list of products as a JSON response from the API, and then renders a list
 of cards, each containing product information. You've already implemented the API call to retrieve the list
 of products on the server-side, and now you need to render the list of cards on the server-side. You're using
 React's ReactDOMServer.renderToString method to render the component to a string.

Which of the following approaches would you use to optimize the server-side rendering of the search results page for improved performance?

Use React's shouldComponentUpdate method to minimize the number of re-renders on the server-side.

Use Redux's connect method to connect the search results component to the Redux store, and then render the component on the server-side.

= Use a caching layer, such as Redis, to cache the rendered HTML of the search results page.

Use a library like Next.js to handle server-side rendering and routing for the entire application.

Reason: Using a caching layer like Redis to cache the rendered HTML of the search results page is an effective way 
to optimize server-side rendering for improved performance. By caching the rendered HTML, you can reduce the load on 
your server by serving cached content for repeated requests, thereby improving response times and reducing server processing overhead.
