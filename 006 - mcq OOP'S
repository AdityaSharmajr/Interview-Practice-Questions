In a social media platform, a developer is tasked with designing a system to handle user interactions with posts.
 The system should be able to handle various types of posts, such as images, videos, and text-only posts. The 
developer decides to use object-oriented programming principles to design the system.

The developer creates a base class called Post with properties such as id, content, and createdAt. The developer
 also creates subclasses ImagePost, VideoPost, and TextPost that inherit from the Post class. Each subclass has 
additional properties specific to its type, such as imageURL for ImagePost and videoURL for VideoPost.

When a user interacts with a post, the system should be able to determine the type of post and display it accordingly.
 For example, if a user likes an image post, the system should display the image and update the like count.

Which of the following principles of object-oriented programming is used in this design?

= Inheritance is used to create a new class that is a modified version of an existing class.
Polymorphism is used to write methods that can work with objects of different classes.
Encapsulation is used to hide the implementation details of an object from the outside world.
Abstraction is used to show only the necessary information to the outside world.
