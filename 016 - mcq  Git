A startup, "EduTech", is developing a new e-learning platform that allows teachers to create and share 
interactive lesson plans with their students. The development team consists of 5 members, and they are
 using Git as their version control system. They have been working on the project for a month and have
made several changes to the codebase. However, they realize that they need to revert back to a previous
 version of the codebase because they introduced a bug that broke the entire application. They want to
 go back to a specific commit that was made two weeks ago.

What command should they use to retrieve the commit history and find the specific commit they want to revert back to?

= git log -p
git branch -a
git reset --hard HEAD~2
gitk --all
