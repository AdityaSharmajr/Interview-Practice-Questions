E-commerce websites often have multiple categories of products, and each category has its own unique
 layout and design. You are tasked with creating a responsive e-commerce website using SASS for styling.
 The website has three main categories: Electronics, Fashion, and Home Decor. Each category has a different
 background color and font style.

The Electronics category should have a dark blue background (#212121) with a font size of 18px and a font
 family of Arial. The Fashion category should have a light pink background (#FFC5C5) with a font size of 
16px and a font family of Times New Roman. The Home Decor category should have a light green background 
(#C6EFCE) with a font size of 17px and a font family of Helvetica.

Write a SASS code that uses nesting and variables to define the styles for each category. You can assume
 that the HTML structure for the categories is already defined, and you only need to focus on writing the SASS code.

Use the following variables: $dark-blue: #212121;, $light-pink: #FFC5C5;, $light-green: #C6EFCE;, $arial: 
Arial;, $times-new-roman: Times New Roman;, and $helvetica: Helvetica;.

Note: You can use the @each loop or any other method to define the styles for each category.

// Define variables
$dark-blue: #212121;
$light-pink: #FFC5C5;
$light-green: #C6EFCE;
$arial: Arial;
$times-new-roman: "Times New Roman";
$helvetica: Helvetica;

// Define categories with their styles
.categories {
  // Define styles for each category
  &__electronics {
    background-color: $dark-blue;
    font-size: 18px;
    font-family: $arial;
    h2 {
      font-weight: bold;
    }
  }

  &__fashion {
    background-color: $light-pink;
    font-size: 16px;
    font-family: $times-new-roman;
    h2 {
      font-style: italic;
    }
  }

  &__home-decor {
    background-color: $light-green;
    font-size: 17px;
    font-family: $helvetica;
    h2 {
      text-decoration: underline;
    }
  }
}
